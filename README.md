# MNIST MODEL Using Numpy and Maths ~ made by Sourasish Mondal
This is a basic Handwritten Number Recognition Model from the famous MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset.

I have only used Python, Numpy and Mathematics to make this model. 
I used Pandas to read the data and matplotlib to show the predicted output <br>

**This Neural Network comprises of two simple layer architecture.** <br>
- Input Layer A<sup>[0]</sup> will have 784 units corresponding to the 784 pixels in each 28x28 input image. <br>
- Hidden Layer <sup>A[1]</sup> will have 10 units with ReLU activation.<br>
- Output Layer <sup>A[2]</sup> will have 10 units corresponding to the ten digit classes with softmax activation. <br>

<p>The <b>math </b> behind it is given below: </p>
